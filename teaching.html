I have taught several courses in text mining and machine learning.

<p>
I have posted some lecture slides on <a href="https://github.com/sekhansen/machine_learning_economics"> Github </a>.

I have also posted the source code that I wrote for several of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/sekhansen/text-mining-tutorial"> https://github.com/sekhansen/text-mining-tutorial </a>, where you can also find an accompanying tutorial.
