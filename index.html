    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p>I am a Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ucl-department-economics"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University College London</a>. My current research uses
        unstructured data to build new
        measures of economic activity and behavior across a variety of applications, most often related to
        organizational
        economics and monetary policy. I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/sekhansen" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Github page</a> where I share code and lecture slides related to methodologies for
        the
        analysis of unstructured and high-dimensional data. I co-organize the monthly <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/view/amleds/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMLEDS</a>
        webinar
        that explores economic applications of machine learning. My research is supported by an ERC Conslidator Grant.

        <h5> Macro Shocks and Firm-Level Response Heterogeneity </h5>
        <div class="authors">
            with Steven Davis and Cristhian Seminario-Amez
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>We combine jump-date stock returns with the text of corporate filings to build firm-level measures of
                shock exposure. Heterogeneous exposure to macro shocks generates countercyclical dispersion in
                firm-level outcomes. </p>

        <h5> Initial Match and Career Outcomes: Evidence from the NFL Draft </h5>
        <div class="authors">
            with Pablo Casas-Arce, Miguel Martinez-Carrasco, and Asis Martinez-Jerez</div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>NFL draft rules randomly allocate players of similar quality to teams of different quality. But there is
                no effect of initial match on long-term performance, suggesting that firms do not contribute to
                long-term inequality in sufficiently competitive markets.</p>

        <div class="authors">
            with Laura Battaglia, Tim Christensen, and Szymon Sacher</div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Plugging measures derived from AI/ML algorithms into regressions leads to biased estimation but does not
                distort confidence intervals. Valid inference can be performed with a bias correction or maximum
                likelihood estimation.</p>

            <p> We build a unique dataset of daily measures of consumption, investment, output, and employment to study
                the transmission of monetary policy shocks. Consumption and downstream sectors react quickly to shocks,
                which then more slowly propagate to the rest of the economy. </p>
