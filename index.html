    <h3> About Me </h3>
	<p>I am an Associate Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/">Imperial College Business School</a>.  My current research uses unstructured data to build new measures of economic activity and behavior across a variety of applications, most often related to organizational economics and monetary policy.  I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/sekhansen">Github page</a> where I share code and lecture slides related to methodologies for the analysis of unstructured and high-dimensional data. I co-organize the monthly <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/amleds/home">AMLEDS</a> webinar that explores economic applications of machine learning.  My research is supported by an ERC Conslidator Grant.</p>
