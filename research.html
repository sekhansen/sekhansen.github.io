<h2> COVID-19 Pandemic </h2>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/Covid19.pdf"> Tracking the COVID-19 Crisis with High-Resolution Transaction Data </a>
  <br>(with Vasco Carvalho, Juan Garcia, Alvaro Ortiz, Tomasa Rodrigo, Jose V Rodriguez Mora, and Jose Ruiz)
  <br>
</p>

<p>
<small> We use a database of 1.4 billion payments transactions to track the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy response across time, space, and sectors in Spain. </small>
</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy / Central Bank Design </h2>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jme_2019.pdf"> The Long-Run Information Effect of Central Bank Communication </a>
  <br>(with Michael McMahon and Matthew Tong)
  <br><i>Journal of Monetary Economics (2019) 108 (December): 185-202.</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>When central banks communicate signals on uncertainty in economic conditions, they can have their largest impact on long-run yields.  This novel form of information effect explains the market reaction to the Bank of England's Inflation Report very well.</small>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/qje_2018.pdf"> Transparency and Deliberation within the FOMC: a Computational Linguistics Approach</a>
  <br>(with Michael McMahon and Andrea Prat)
  <br><i>Quarterly Journal of Economics (2018) 133 (2): 801-870</i>
</p>
  
<p>
<small>Using communication measures from machine learning, we find evidence for both the conformity and discipline effects predicted by the career concerns literature following an increase in transparency on the Federal Open Market Committee.  On balance, the discipline effect appears stronger, as rookie members become more influential.</small>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/restud_2016.pdf"> First Impressions Matter: Signalling as a Source of Policy Dynamics</a>
<br>(with Michael McMahon)
<br><i>The Review of Economic Studies (2016) 83 (4): 1645-1672</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>A new model of reputation for monetary policy makers predicts that all preference types become softer on inflation over time and that this evolution is more pronounced for types that put more weight on output, predictions we confirm using voting data from the Bank of England.</small>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jie_2016.pdf"> Shocking Language: Understanding the Macroeconomic Effects of Central Bank Communication</a>
<br>(with Michael McMahon)
<br><i>Journal of International Economics (2016), 38th NBER International Seminar on Macroeconomics: S114-S133.</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>We adopt an automated approach to measuring the extent to which Fed statements provide forward guidance versus information on economic conditions.  Overall, the former has larger macroeconomic effects, particularly on market variables.</small>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jme_2014.pdf"> Preferences or Private Assessments on a Monetary Policy Committee?</a>
<br>(with Michael McMahon and Carlos Velasco)
<br><i>Journal of Monetary Economics (2014) 67 (October): 16-32</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>Experts on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee differ both in terms of preferences and private forecasts.  A committee of internal Bank members significantly outperforms an individual because of information pooling, but both large committees and those that add externals appear to add little value.</small>
</p>

<h2>Organizational Economics </h2>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jpe_2020.pdf"> CEO Behavior and Firm Performance</a>
<br>(with Oriana Bandiera, Andrea Prat, and Raffaella Sadun)
<br><i>Journal of Political Economy (2020) 128 (4): 1325-1369.</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>We use a machine learning algorithm applied to granular CEO survey data to construct a scalar behavioral index.  The index is strongly correlated with firm performance, and this relationship appears only several years after CEO appointment.  Evidence suggests the correlation is due to assignment frictions, which are substantially worse in low-income countries.</small>

<a href="./pdf_files/irle_2015.pdf"> Organizing Public Good Provision: Lessons from Managerial Accounting</a>
<br>(with Benito Arru√±ada)
<br><i>International Review of Law and Economics, (2015) 42 (June): 185-191</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>We describe how one can interpret public sector organizations through the lens of managerial accounting, and provide anecdotal evidence that mixing strong incentives with bureaucratic administration works well in various settings.</small>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jleo_2013.pdf"> Performance Feedback with Career Concerns</a>
<br><i>Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization (2013) 29 (6): 1279-1316</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>When workers have career concerns, performance feedback increases the uncertainty of future effort but allows them to manipulate their employers' beliefs on future effort; the optimal policy only reveals intermediate performance levels.</small>
</p>

<h2>Other </h2>

<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jie_2019.pdf"> Vertical Exclusion with Downstream Risk Aversion or Limited Liability </a>
<br>(with Massimo Motta)
<br><i>Journal of Industrial Economics (2019) 67 (3-4): 409-447.</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>When downstream firms are sufficiently risk averse, or subject to limited liability, and cannot observe their competitors' shocks, an upstream firm offers contracts that offer all input to one downstream firm.</small>
</p>


<p>
<a href="./pdf_files/jae_2016.pdf"> Estimating Bayesian Decision Problems with Heterogeneous Expertise</a>
<br>(with Michael McMahon and Tang Srisuma)
<br><i>Journal of Applied Econometrics (2016) 31 (4): 762-771</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>Econometricians can use variation in the prior distribution to substantially improve the accuracy of existing techniques for estimating decision-makers' preferences and private signal distributions.</small>
